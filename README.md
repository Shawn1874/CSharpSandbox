# CodeSamplesCpp
Sandbox for experimenting with concepts using the CPlusPlus Language.

This is my first ever git hub project, where I will store experimental code for learning new concepts as I continue in my journey as a CPlusPlus programmer.

I've been using Git for approximately 2 years now.  I use SVN in my current job, but using Github I can continue to maintain my skills using Git as I practice and learn new concepts.  I'm especially interested in practicing the use of new language features of the C11 and C14 specficiation changes.
